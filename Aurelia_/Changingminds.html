  Changing Minds! is a project which aims to exchange practices between
  a diverse range of youth and community based organisations in both Ireland and
  Romania which deal with young people in the area of youth work, disability,
  challenging stereotypes and influencing policy.
 <br><!--This is a break-->
 <br><!--This is a break-->
  With the help of the latest digital technology, the overall objectives,
  supporting the main aim of exchanging and learning from models of good practice are:

  (1) To change attitudes and prejudices often encountered in Ireland in relation to
  people from less developed countries (this partnership will focus on negative attitudes
  towards people from Romania which, if successful, will lead to be people becoming more
  positive and welcoming towards EU citizens from ALL countries).
 <br><!--This is a break-->
  (2) To change negative perceptions of disability which are evident in less developed
  EU countries (again we will start by focusing on Romania – and then expanding to
  include all countries).

  Central to this will be two learning activities, whereby young Irish and Romanian
  people will be given the opportunity to gain first-hand experience of working with
  people with disability within Romania, as well as taking part in interactive workshops,
  conferences and being upskilled in digital media technology. It is hoped that this
  exchange experience will help the young participants to promote change amongst their
  peers and at local and regional level, whilst at the same time attempting to impact
  on policy change at EU level.<p><!--This is a paragraph-->
