 <p>The Aurelia Trust aim to improve the lives of abandoned children
 and young adults in Romania, primarily those that grew up in the orphanage
 system during the Ceaușescu regime who have been institutionalised since birth.
 As a result of the trauma that they endured they have acquired severe mental
 and physical disabilities and many shut down all but their most basic
 survival instincts.

 In 2006 the campaign to close the infamous Negru Vodă institution wa
 successful. The children moved to a new centre in Techirghiol,
 a huge improvement, but it still lacks basic facilities.

 The main focus of our work is to improve the lives of children and young
 people in state institutions by offering alternative forms of care such
 as fostering, adoption, the creation of group homes and by upgrading the
 institutions in which they live. Many of the children we work with
 have suffered appalling levels of deprivation which has resulted in
 both physical and psychiatric/psychological disabilities.
 During the intense summer heat and freezing winters the young people are
 confined to their rooms as the centre lacks a communal area.

 The volunteers travel to Romania to assist local care workers
 with our annual summer camp programme, the Tabara.

 The anticipation and memory of the Tabara is a big
 part of life in the centre. It is amazing to see how they
 benefit from the one-to-one mental and physical interaction
 with our volunteers. A huge highlight is the opportunity to
 go to the beach. For the majority, it is their only chance to
 leave the centre during the year.

 All volunteers give their time freely and pay all their own
 travel costs. This ensures that all donations to go directly
 to those in need.<p>
