<i>The Cullinane family started the grocery and bakery business in 1865, but the Ring. family took it over in 1890 and ran it until 1935, when Jack and Maureen Field bought it. On that date, they made a commitment to supply only the finest produce and baked goods, and to offer a peerless service to all their customers – a tradition that has been continued by the third generation of the family to the present day. The old shop has been revamped many times in the last 75 years. In fact, every four or five years, the family makes a considerable investment in the business with a view to creating a SuperValu unlike any other. By continually enlarging and improving the different departments in the supermarket – which has grown to become a massive 20,000 sq ft superstore –  Field’s has kept pace with developments in the industry, but still managed to retain its unique appeal. Having a modern shop is important, but so too is the need to retain the traditional values on which  the business was built.</i>
