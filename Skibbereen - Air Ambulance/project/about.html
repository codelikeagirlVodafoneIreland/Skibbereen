<h3>Irish Community Rapid Response was established in 2008 to deliver professional pre hospital care directly to the site of medical emergencies throughout Ireland. Our volunteer doctors have made a significant difference while working in association with the National Ambulance Service when responding to 999/112 emergency calls.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Building on our experience and success we will provide Irelandâ€™s first dedicated charity funded helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS). Based out of Cork Airport, Irish Community Air Ambulance will provide a vital lifesaving service, offering fast access to advanced clinical interventions at the roadside by highly trained pre-hospital emergency care medical personel.</h3>
