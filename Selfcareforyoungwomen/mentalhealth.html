<h1>Mental Health</h1>
<p><strong><u>Self confidence</u></strong>
  <br>
  <br>
 In today’s society women are pressured to look a certain way to fit in with society’s version of “beautiful”. But there is no such thing as one type of beautiful.
 A rainbow and a flower are both beautiful, but cannot be compared to one another.
 <br>
 Whatever you think is imperfect within yourself or with your appearance, even if you change that you’re still going to believe that you are imperfect
  because being self-conscious is a mentality.
  You need to love yourself before anything else.<p>
    <strong>Tips to Improve your Self-esteem:</strong>
<ol>
  <li>Don’t compare yourself to other people
 You might think someone is more attractive than you but the fact is that everyone is different and beautiful in their own way.
 The world would be boring if we were all the same so you should love your individuality and love who you are.</li>
 <li><strong>Tell yourself “You’re Beautiful” everyday</strong></li>
Look in the mirror and say to yourself over and over again “ I love you” and “you’re beautiful”,
 each time with more meaning everyday until you begin to believe it yourself
 <li><strong> Wear the Clothes that you want to Wear</strong></li>
 Don’t think about what others think of what you wear, wear what you want to wear and feel confident and beautiful doing so.
  It is your choice and nobody should be able to effect that.
</ol>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Depression</u></strong>
  <p>Depression
Depression is different from feeling down or sad. Unhappiness is something which everyone feels at one time or another, usually due to a particular cause.
 Dealing with depression needs action, but doing so when depressed can be difficult.
<br>

  It’s important to stay in contact with friends and family.
  This plays a vital role in curing depression. You may find it difficult to reach out for help and will want to isolate yourself,
   but it’s important to know that you have love and support from your loved ones.
<br>
 Find things to do that you love and feel relaxed doing. Take care of yourself and make sure that you’re getting 8 hours of sleep at night,
  eating healthily, exercise and drinking plenty of water. This will help you to feel stronger and strengthen your mentality.
  Try out meditation to help relax and clear your mind of negative thoughts.
</p>
<strong><u>Anxiety</u></strong>
  <br>
  <br>
It's a normal part of life to experience occasional anxiety. But you may experience anxiety that is persistent, seemingly uncontrollable, and overwhelming.
 If it's an excessive, irrational dread of everyday situations, it can be disabling.
 When anxiety interferes with daily activities, you may have an anxiety disorder.
 <br>

<ol>
<strong>Tips to reduce anxiety:</strong>
<li>Loosen yourself up to reduce tension in your body.</li>
<li>Breath slowly and deeply</li>

 <li>Notice whether the floor is tidy, dirty, smooth or rough.</li>
    <li>Notice it’s imperfections.</li>

<li>If it’s above a 5, repeat the previous steps.</li>
</ol>
<strong><u>Eating Disorders</u></strong>
<br>
<br>
There are many kinds of eating disorders. From Anorexia Nervosa to obesity, every eating disorder is different and has different symptoms,
but most are connected in cause. Eating disorders often come from having bad self esteem and/or anxiety of what others think of your outer appearance.
<br>
Eating disorders can also be affected by genes and hormones. You don’t have to be underweight to have an eating disorder.
If you suffer with an eating disorder it is important to reach out to a close friend or family member to get support and guidance.
<br>
 It can be hard to treat an eating disorder alone. As each eating disorder is different, it is important to research it and act appropriately.
