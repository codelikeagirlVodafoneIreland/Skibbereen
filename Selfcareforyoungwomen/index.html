 This website is an accessible source of information to improve and learn more about your mental health and
  <br> physical
  health while educating yourself about your power as a women.
<br>
In todays society women are pressured to look a certain
  way to fit in with society's version of "beautiful".

  <br>
   But there is no such thing as one type of beautiful.
<br>
  A rainbow and a flower are both beautiful, but cannot be compared to one another.
  <br>

   Whatever you think is imperfect within yourself
  or with your appearance, even if you change that,
  <br>
  you're still going to believe that you are imperfect because being
  self-concious is a mentality.
  <br>
   You need to love yourself before anything else. This website focuses on <strong> you
  </strong> and <strong> you </strong> only.
