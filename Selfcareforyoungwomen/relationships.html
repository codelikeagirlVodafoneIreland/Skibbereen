  <h1>Relationship Advice</h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Relationships</u></strong>
    <br>
    <br>
  During your teenage years, you are still figuring out who you are and becoming an adult.
  You will lose relationships with people during this time as you develop,
  <br>
   but you will also make many new friends and expand your relationships
  with people you already know.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Family:</strong>
  <br>
  Many teens will go through a stage where they disagree with and disobey the advice their parents/families give them.
  This is known as the “rebellious stage”. You may think that your parents are wrong and that they have it out for you,
   but it’s important to remember that they love you and they are doing what they believe is in your best interest.
    Remember to keep a relationship with your family as they can give you the support that you need in times of hardship.
     If you are unable to get the love and support you need from your family, it’s important to have friends to confide in.
     <br>
     <br>
     <strong>Friends:</strong>
     <br>
  During your teenage years, your friends are going to be the people you confide in the most.
  Whether you are a social person with many friends or a shy person with a few, close friends,
  <br>
  its vital to keep up relationships with the people that support you and in turn need supporting.
   Keep friends who love you just the way you are and know you better than anyone else.
   <br>
    Liberate yourself from any negative, angry people in your life and focus on positivity and self love.
     When tension arrives in friendships you should get to understand all the sides of the story and not over react. Brash decisions can end good friendships.
     <br>
     <br>
     <strong>Romantic Relationships:</strong>
     <br>
     As a young adult you may have been, or currently be in a romantic relationship. As every two people are different there’s really no way to judge,
     <br>
      what will work out or not.  Entering a new relationship can be exciting, but many people rush in without thinking.
      It’s not uncommon for relationships to be toxic or unhealthy, it can take time to realise this,
      <br>
      it may also be the group of people you associate your significant other with, are toxic or not good for you in the long-term.
       If this applies to you, the best and hardest thing to do for yourself, is cut yourself off from it, you deserve to be protective over your mental health.
       <br>
        There will always be people willing to be supportive for you and its best to turn to them instead of the people you’re trying to forget, as hard as that might be.
         Make sure you recognise the people trying to help and support you no matter what, and be careful not to distance yourself around them or build a wall,
         <br>
          allow yourself to be vulnerable, so you can heal.
