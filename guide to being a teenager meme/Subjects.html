<h1>Picking Subects</h1>
<p>Picking subjects can be a very daunting experience, especially when you're coming to a school, where you will have multiple teachers, from a primary school
 with one room and one teacher. There are a couple of things that are important to take into consideration when you pick your subjects and when you are trying
 your subjects (if your school has that facility.)</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3> The Teacher </h3>
  <p>If you enjoy a subject and are good at it, don't be put off by what others may say about them or your personal preconceptions of them put you off doing the
  subject, the chances are you won't continue having them for that subject for the full duration of the Junior Cycle. The teachers are there to help you
  get your education, not to prevent you from it.</p>
<br>
<h3> Your Friends </h3>
 <p>You might be inclined to select your subjects based on what subjects your friends are doing. Do <b> NOT </b> do this. Your friends might be talented and
 interested in subjects that you mightn't do so well in. Everybody has different talents and it's important to understand this before choosing your subjects.
 By doing subjects that your friends aren't doing you will make friends with other people in those classes, widening your circle.<p>
<br>
<h3> Subjects Outside of School</h3>
 <p>If there are timetable restrictions that make it impossible for you to take a subject you particularly enjoy you could
 consider taking it outside school, provided you factor in an appropriate amount of study time to cover all your other
 subjects. Alternatily, you might consider changing schools at the beginning of fifth year, to ensure that you get your
 desired subject choices.</p>
<br>
<h3> Boy:Girl Ratio </h3>
<br>
  <img id="friendship" src="friendship.jpg" alt="Picture of Friends Jumping">
<br><br>
 <p>If you are considering taking a class where the majority of students are of the opposite gender, eg,if you
 are a boy and want to do a French class whereby the majority of the class is female </i>  don't feel pressured
 to not do it. By the time you start to do the class it will not make any difference.</p>
<br>
<h3>Your Parent's Ideas </h3>
 <p>Your parents may want you to do certain subjects that they enjoyed in school or did not have the opportunity to do in
 school, if you are interested in those same subjects great, but if not there is no real point. You will be the one doing
 the subject and will have to put in the work, you are more likely to put in more effort to a subject that you genuinely
 enjoy. <i> Your mum who wanted you to do Woodwork won't do the study for you.</i> Choose based on your own interests,
 not your parents'.</p>
