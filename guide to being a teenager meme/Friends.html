<h1> Friends in Secondary School</h1>

<br><br><br>
Many children start secondary school expecting to make new friends. At the same time, they are concerned that they may lose contact with their current friends, particularly if they’re changing schools. For some children, the desire to stay with their group of friends influences where they would prefer to go to secondary school – and if they move to a different school they wonder how they will keep in touch and sustain their friendships.
<br>
Friends help each other make the transition from primary to secondary school easier. Friends are people that your child can talk to, share things with, confide in and sometimes argue with. <i>Remember, conflict is a normal part of growing up. </i> Conflict is not necessarily bullying, even though it may be upsetting and need resolution.
<br>
Parents and friends play different roles in the life of children. Your parents influence your long-term decisions to do with values and morals. Your friends are <b> more likely </b> to influence short-term choices, such as the way they dress and their interests. Strong relationships with your parents and your friends help you grow into a well-adjusted adult with strong social skills.
<br>
Right now, your  friendships will tend to be based on sharing similar interests, acceptance and sharing. Same-sex friendships are the norm during the first years of secondary school.
<br><br>
<h2> Talking to your Parents </h2>
<br>
Friendships need time, attention and trust if they are to survive. Ensure you have the opportunity to spend time with their friends to maintain your connection.
<br>
Talk to your parents about your friends– what things you like to do with them and the things you appreciate or like about your friends. Talk about ways you could show their friends how much they mean to you.
<br>
Talking with your parents can also give you the chance to start a conversation about how things are going with your friends, and they are more likely to listen to you about any problems that come up. Ask questions about friends and your parents' experiences.  This might help them see other options and help you to feel understood..
<br>
Learn about forgiveness. Sometimes friends do things that upset us. This doesn’t mean the friendship has to end. Understanding that everyone makes mistakes is an important lesson to learn.
