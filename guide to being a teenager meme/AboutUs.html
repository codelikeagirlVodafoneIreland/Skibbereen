    <h1>Why We Made Our Page</h1>
<br>
Teenagers face real problems on a daily basis during the most awkward growth stages of their lives; between 13 and 19-years-old.
During this time, teens are exposed to some overwhelming external and internal struggles. Teens go through, and are expected to cope with hormonal changes,
puberty, social and parental forces, work and school pressures, as well as encountering many conditions and problems. Teens feel overwhelmed when faced with
unprecedented stresses concerning school and college, and career confusion situations. Those who have absentee parents are exposed to more unfavorable states
of life. The issues that teenagers face today vary but these issues can be dealt with easily if parents and other guardians can understand the symptoms of their
problems. Parents need to approach their children, who have been suffering from one or more teenage problems, carefully and in a friendly manner to discuss
the problem(s).
<br><br>
Our aim of this page is to provide a resource and safe space for teenagers as we understand that talking to parents about everything can be awkward especially during the teenage years when we are growing independence and figuring out things for ourselves. We also understand, as teenagers, that parents can be<i> embarrassing</i> at
times and don't seem to understand everything. We believe strongly in talking to parents as well but this page is an extra resource for teenagers.
