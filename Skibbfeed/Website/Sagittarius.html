<p>As your astrology horoscope week begins Sagittarius and Sagittarius rising the planet Mars ruler of your solar sector of taking chances, ardent and passionate love, dating, children and entertainment is in the serious sign of Capricorn.   Mars rules activity, actions and offensive or defensive plays is in the sign of Capricorn, where Mars is exalted.  It’s all business, all about big government, professional ambitions, ethics, professionalism, your career, desire for success and ambitions.   Remember this is where Saturn and Pluto are transiting and where things get very serious and the stakes are high.   Mars is also out of bounds until April 6th too, so think outside the box.  Mars in Capricorn suggests you might spend more to make sure your children or love interest have the absolute best money can be or you could in the other direction and pull back the money from the ones you love.  You might find ways to have fun on the cheap or deny yourself all that makes you happiest.  You become more aware of your ego, how love overpowers your good senses and you probably don’t want to spoil anyone but create healthier personal relationships.  That’s your responsibility.  In the past you might have been impulsive and carefree but not anyone more.

The New Moon started a new cycle in Pisces where the planet Venus is exalted your 4th house of home, family matters deeply felt emotions, beginnings, endings and letting go.   That could have impacted your finances, in a temporary sort of way or your relationships with women, girlfriends, sisters or just women in general.

The planets Mercury and Venus get together in the sign of Aries this week.  There’s more thinking, and communications, the sharing of ideas, brainstorming and talk about meeting up romantically or making money.   Big ideas and grandiose schemes are talked about, but will they come to fruition?  Mercury rules thinking, communications, new ideas and transportation and is getting ready to go retrograde in Aries making you re-think, redo and think twice or three times about something you said, how you were treated, your finances and when you jumped to conclusions.  By the time Mercury goes direct, Venus will be in a softer place, but a slower moving place, the sign of Taurus, a sign she rules.  This week Venus is in her detriment in Aries and is quick to pooh-pooh ideas, people or activities.   You might have some new ideas and projects you’re working on but there’s part of you that isn’t just jumping in and trusting freely. You’re protecting your finances and your pride.  If anyone makes you feel less than or questions your motives you’re going to remember that.  This week you’re more careful about making promises and even picking up the phone and the alliances you make.   In many ways you are starting over again.

This week the planet Mars influences both Mercury and Venus and remember Mars is out of bounds in the sign of his exaltation Capricorn.  It might not be a good idea to take your frustrations out on those closest to you, but rather reconfigure, or think about changes you can make with your own personal or professional goals.  You can talk over things, get excited by grandiose plans, with new friends or acquaintances, but will they fall short or find fertile ground in the future.   In short, something you do or say this week, like being short, coarse or defensive could impact your future and your relationships.  You can get excited by new people, and conversations but getting short with old friends or family members might be a mistake.  Mars in Capricorn slows your processes down and you demand and expect your monies worth.  Everything has to have value according to you.  The changes in Sagittarius can surprise many.

The Sun enters Aries and it’s the Spring Equinox a time when the Sun is directly above and there’s balance between night and day.  It’s time to also find your own balance.  It’s time to get your life back in balance.  The Sun in Aries suggest it’s time to spring into action, but to also be ready to adjust or make changes for the future when Mercury goes direct after April 15th.  No worries, you’ve got time to think about things.  Sagittarius like everyone else has to re-center themselves and their lives.  You might have to be more, or less detached or give more freedom to your children or a love interest.  You might need to figure out what makes you happy all over again. You might have to start dating again.

As the planet of love, money, wealth, marriage, women, sisters, and the feminine counterpart of any relationship, the planet Venus in Aries squares Pluto in Capricorn at 21°.  Big decisions that involve children, a love or power struggles and difference over money threaten your happiness.  There’s going to be a permanent ending.  Additionally,  the Sun in Aries squares Mars in Capricorn at 3°, expect to feel done with someone or very hurt or disrespected.  There can also be a power play or standoff.  Expect a Good bye.

It’s not a good day when Venus in Aries aspects Jupiter RX in Scorpio at 22°, in your 12th house of secrets, karma and completions.  You can expect unfair funny business or secrets to be revealed with your romantic partner, you can feel ignored, betrayed, jealous and you have to watch your credit and banking information.  But these two planets both beneficial planets so there could be a blessing in disguise.  You can jump into a purely physical relationship or become smitten with someone you think has oodles of money or power.   There’s something wrong with this picture though.  Venus in Aries her detriment, where Venus is not happy and tends to rush to judgement and Jupiter RX is retrograde in Scorpio which is all about intimacy, power, money, magnetism and mysteries.  This suggests either you are not taking enough time to fully get to the bottom of something or you’re not even trying to understand what’s really going on.  Maybe you must explain to someone how your bank account was compromised, and you have a good reason for not paying on time.  Maybe there’s a relationship, partnership or friendship that deep in your heart you’ve been questioning well, the planets are giving you a way out.  More patience is needed this week.  Sagittarius is in a cycle of having to let go, and loosen the tight reigns they may have on their feelings or what they consider theirs.
