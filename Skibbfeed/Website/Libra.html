<p><b>Libra: (Sep.23-Oct. 23): </n>As your astrology horoscope week begins Libra and Libra rising the planet Mars ruler of not just your relationship zone but significant others, marriage, but also actions and offensive or defensive plays.  Mars is in the sign of Capricorn, where Mars is exalted.  It’s all business, all about big government, professional ambitions, ethics, professionalism, your career, desire for success and ambitions.   Remember this is where Saturn and Pluto are transiting and where things get very serious and the stakes are high.   Mars is also out of bounds until April 6th too, so think outside the box.  Since this is your 4th house, and the bottom of your solar chart, you feel things deeply.  This is the house of beginnings, endings, self-sufficiency, deeply felt emotions, where you must let go, and make it on your own, your emotions and pride are woven into all you do.  You’re feeling powerful emotions, but can you express them.  It’s a time of letting go or a time when someone let’s go of you.  This influences family, property matters, and deeply felt emotions, or painful ones.

The New Moon started a new cycle in Pisces where the planet Venus is exalted your 6th house of work, health, fixing things and sometimes conflicts.   This could have impacted your work, finances, in a temporary sort of way or your relationships with women, girlfriends, sisters or just women in general.  You need to be inspired! Find things that inspire you to keep going.

The planets Mercury and Venus get together in the sign of Aries this week, your relationship, others and marriage zone and no doubt you long  to be seen and more popular.  You want attention and perhaps from ne friends and people you encounter but also from people you used to know or be close to.   All the planets signify a change is coming in your life.  There’s communications, sharing ideas, brainstorming and talk about meeting up romantically or making money.   Big ideas and grandiose schemes are talked about, but will they come to fruition?  Mercury rules thinking, communications, new ideas and transportation and is getting ready to go retrograde in Aries making you re-think, redo and think twice or three times about something you said, how you were treated, your finances and when you jumped to conclusions.  By the time Mercury goes direct, Venus will be in a softer place, but a slower moving place, the sign of Taurus, a sign she rules.  This week Venus is in her detriment in Aries and is quick to pooh-pooh ideas, people or activities.  Mars, Saturn and Pluto are transiting your 4th house and this is where things change, and you deal with your emotions but where you also have to keep your base of operations and finances a float too.  There just isn’t enough time to stop, lament, weep, grieve or mourn.  Avoid being too hyper sensitive, or grouchy and avoid pushing others away.

This week the planet Mars influences both Mercury and Venus and remember Mars is out of bounds in the sign of his exaltation Capricorn so find a way to move things around, even when it comes to paying the bills.   Think outside the box when it comes to dealing with family members.  It might not be a good idea to take your frustrations out on those closest to you, but rather reconfigure, or think about changes you can make with your own personal or professional goals.  You can talk over things, get excited by grandiose plans, with new friends or acquaintances, but will they fall short or find fertile ground in the future.   In short, something you do or say this week, like being short, coarse or defensive could impact your future and your relationships.  You can get excited by new people, and conversations but getting short with old friends or family members might be a mistake.

The Sun enters Aries your relationship zone and it’s the Spring Equinox a time when the Sun is directly above and there’s balance between night and day.  It’s time to also find your own balance.  It’s time to get your life back in balance.  The Sun in Aries suggest it’s time to spring into action, but to also be ready to adjust or make changes for the future when Mercury goes direct after April 15th.  No worries, you’ve got time to think about things.  What’s right and what’s wrong with this picture.  Libra if you’re going to move on to a healthy relationship and single Libra if you’re going to find your forever lover you have to dig deeper.  You have to be more loveable, and more approachable.  Certainly, having Mars, Saturn and Pluto in your 4th house of emotions, nurturing and feelings does not spell approachable won’t you agree?

As the planet of love, money, wealth, marriage, women, sisters, and the feminine counterpart of any relationship, the planet Venus in Aries squares Pluto in Capricorn at 21°.  There’s decisions that must be made this week related to home, property matters, and being self-sufficient.  There’s decisions related to relationships, your significant other or marriage that also come up.  There’s going to be a permanent ending.  Additionally,  the Sun in Aries squares Mars in Capricorn at 3°, you feel like moving on, so expect to feel done with someone or very hurt or disrespected.  There can also be a power play or standoff.  Expect a Good bye.

It’s not a good day when Venus in Aries aspects Jupiter RX in Scorpio at 22°, you can expect unfair funny business with your romantic partner, you can feel ignored, betrayed, jealous and you have to watch your credit and banking information.  How someone makes you feel could be the determining factor in a big decision you make.  These two planets are both beneficial planets so there could be a blessing in disguise.  Maybe you must explain to someone how your bank account was compromised, and you have a good reason for not paying on time.  Maybe there’s a relationship, partnership or friendship that deep in your heart you’ve been questioning well, the planets are giving you a way out.  Everything this week s about how you feel so you have to examine your emotions and do some serious soul searching.
