<p><b>Aries (Mar 20-April 20)</b> As your astrology horoscope week begins your very serious Aries and Aries Rising  the planet Mars your ruler and the ruler of activity,
  actions and offensive or defensive plays is in the sign of Capricorn, where Mars is exalted.
  It’s all business, all about big government, professional ambitions, ethics, professionalism, your career, desire for success and ambitions.
  Remember this is where Saturn and Pluto are transiting and where things get very serious and the stakes are high.
   Mars is also out of bounds until April 6th too, so think outside the box.
   You don’t want to be bothered and many things that occur now have you questioning yourself.
   You need to be on guard for people taking advantage or affecting you financially.
    No, you don’t owe anyone implicit trust, that’s earned.</p>

<p>The New Moon started a new cycle in Pisces where the planet Venus is exalted and you may be you felt it was OK to be alone, that way you could make yourself and your ideas stand out more.   That could have impacted your finances, in a temporary sort of way or your relationships with women, girlfriends, sisters or just women in general.</p>

<p>The planets Mercury and Venus get together in the sign of Aries your Sun sign this week.  That pus lots of emphasis on you being you and your finances of course.  There’s communications, sharing ideas, brainstorming and talk about meeting up romantically or making money.   Still, the planets suggest you really don’t need to share ideas with others.   Big ideas and grandiose schemes are talked about, but will they come to fruition?  Aries could opt to stick with what has worked in the past.  Mercury rules thinking, communications, new ideas and transportation and is getting ready to go retrograde in Aries making you re-think, redo and think twice or three times about something you said, how you were treated, your finances and when you jumped to conclusions.  By the time Mercury goes direct, Venus will be in a softer place, but a slower moving place, the sign of Taurus, a sign she rules.  This week Venus is in her detriment in Aries and is quick to pooh-pooh ideas, people or activities.   This week you fly solo to achieve your dreams and stay on course.  While others get flustered you don’t. </p>

<p>This week the planet Mars influences both Mercury and Venus and remember Mars is out of bounds in the sign of his exaltation Capricorn so Aries you might be on to something when it comes to putting your own individual spin on things.  It might not be a good idea to take your frustrations out on those closest to you, but rather reconfigure, or think about changes you can make with your own personal or professional goals.  You can talk over things, get excited by grandiose plans, with new friends or acquaintances, but will they fall short or find fertile ground in the future.   In short, something you do or say this week, like being short, coarse or defensive could impact your future and your relationships.  You can get excited by new people, and conversations but getting short with old friends or family members might be a mistake.  In love, Aries there’s trouble brewing and No, you shouldn’t blindly trust anyone right now. </p>

<p>The Sun enters Aries your Sun sign and it’s the Spring Equinox a time when the Sun is directly above and there’s balance between night and day.  It’s time to also find your own balance.  It’s time to get your life back in balance.  The Sun in Aries suggest it’s time to spring into action, but to also be ready to adjust or make changes for the future when Mercury goes direct after April 15th.  No worries, you’ve got time to think about things.  Your instincts tell you that it’s time to get back on track and rid yourself of what’s not necessary right now.  Your focus is getting on track and fixing what’s not working with your career, profession, personal goals and finances.  You’ll try to be nice about it, but no one’s getting in your way. </p>

<p>As the planet of love, money, wealth, marriage, women, sisters, and the feminine counterpart of any relationship, the planet Venus in Aries squares Pluto in Capricorn at 21°, you are very serious this week and to say you’re done with someone, is quite the understatement.   There’s going to be a permanent ending because you’re all about getting ahead and all about what you want this week.  Additionally,  the Sun in Aries squares Mars in Capricorn at 3°, expect to feel done with someone or very hurt or disrespected.  There can also be a power play or standoff.  Expect a Good bye.  You might also not mince words even though you have lots to say to someone, it’s just going to start a fight.  Keep your words to yourself and just close the door. </p>

<p>It’s not a good day when Venus in Aries aspects Jupiter RX in Scorpio at 22°, you can expect unfair funny business with your romantic partner, you can feel ignored, betrayed, jealous and you have to watch your credit and banking information.  But these two planetary both beneficial planets so there could be a blessing in disguise.  Maybe you must explain to someone how your bank account was compromised, and you have a good reason for not paying on time.  Maybe there’s a relationship, partnership or friendship that deep in your heart you’ve been questioning well, the planets are giving you a way out.  Aries has decisions to make and anyone or anything that gets in the way of their success must go.</p>
