<h1>Drake Gives Away $1 Million in His Extremely Adorable "God's Plan" Video</h1>
<br>

<p><h3>If Drake's incessant lint-rolling and ridiculous dance moves haven't already caused you to fall hopelessly in love with him, maybe his newly released video for "God's Plan" will. In the clip, Drake surprises various charity organizations and residents of Miami with almost $1 million, for no apparent reason other than he feels like it. "The budget for this video was $996,631.90," the video begins. "We gave it all away. Don't tell the label."

Throughout the video, Drake gives $50,000 to a women's shelter, $50,000 to the University of Miami, and piles of cash to adorably surprised fans he meets on the street. He also goes to a grocery store and picks up everyone's tabs and presents a bunch of children with shopping carts full of toys. On Instagram, Drake called the video the "most important thing" he's ever done in his career. And if all that still hasn't melted your heart, he also dances on an escalator.
