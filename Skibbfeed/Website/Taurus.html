<p><b>Taurus: (Apr. 20-May 21): </b> As your astrology horoscope week begins Taurus and Taurus Rising the planet Mars ruler of your 12th house of the past, losses, debts and karmic completions is active, and on the on offensive or defensive helping you to put something to rest.  Mars is in the sign of Capricorn, where Mars is exalted.  It’s all business, Taurus.  It’s also all about big government, professional ambitions, ethics, professionalism, your career, desire for success and ambitions.   Remember this is where Saturn and Pluto are transiting and where things get very serious and the stakes are high.   Mars is also out of bounds until April 6th too, so think outside the box.  Think outside the box about past debts, your personal karma, feelings of loss or having much to complete.  It’s time or almost time to start something new and close the door to your past!  It’s an exciting time to be a Taurus or Taurus rising.</p>

<p>The New Moon started a new cycle in Pisces where your ruler the planet Venus is exalted.   That could have impacted your finances, in a temporary sort of way or your relationships with women, girlfriends, sisters or just women in general.  Perhaps you started to see yourself in someone else or see what someone else has accomplished and say to yourself “I can do that too”.   Find someone you want to emulate or be like, a role model. </p>

<p>The planets Mercury and Venus get together in the sign of Aries this week and one can feel hurried or rushed which isn’t that comfortable to slow and steady Taurus.  That’s not to say that you can’t handle deadlines or don’t have patience when things don’t work out the way you want them to.  You do.  There’s communications, sharing ideas, brainstorming and talk about meeting up romantically or making money.   Big ideas and grandiose schemes are talked about, but will they come to fruition?  Mercury rules thinking, communications, new ideas and transportation and is getting ready to go retrograde in Aries making you re-think, redo and think twice or three times about something you said, how you were treated, your finances and when you jumped to conclusions.  By the time Mercury goes direct, Venus will be in a softer place, but a slower moving place, the sign of Taurus, a sign she rules.  This week Venus is in her detriment in Aries and is quick to pooh-pooh ideas, people or activities. Supporting you are the planets Mars, Saturn and Pluto bringing you good timing and a positive attitude.  You can do the impossible this week especially under pressure.  </p>

<p>This week the planet Mars influences both Mercury and Venus and remember Mars is out of bounds in the sign of his exaltation Capricorn.  In your lucky and fortunate 9thhouse of new experiences you’re all about finding a better way to do things.  This week you want more.  You might have to wait a little bit, but more is coming.  It might not be a good idea to take your frustrations out on those closest to you, but rather reconfigure, or think about changes you can make with your own personal or professional goals.  You can talk over things, get excited by grandiose plans, with new friends or acquaintances, but will they fall short or find fertile ground in the future.   In short, something you do or say this week, like being short, coarse or defensive could impact your future and your relationships.  You can get excited by new people, and conversations but getting short with old friends or family members might be a mistake.</p>

<p>The Sun enters Aries and it’s the Spring Equinox a time when the Sun is directly above and there’s balance between night and day.  It’s time to also find your own balance.  Taurus you start to balance your job with what you feel you’re getting out of it or not getting out of it.  It could be time to look for another job as the North Node pushes you to raise your standard of living and perhaps move or purchase a new home.  It’s time to get your life back in balance.  The Sun in Aries suggest it’s time to spring into action, but to also be ready to adjust or make changes for the future when Mercury goes direct after April 15th.  No worries, you’ve got time to think about things.  </p>

<p>As the planet of love, money, wealth, marriage, women, sisters, and the feminine counterpart of any relationship, the planet Venus in Aries squares Pluto in Capricorn at 21°.   You have a vision but finding others to agree with you or working through the red tape wont’ be easy.  It won’t be impossible it just requires patience.    There’s going to be a permanent ending.  Additionally,  the Sun in Aries squares Mars in Capricorn at 3°, expect to feel done with someone or very hurt or disrespected.  There can also be a power play or standoff.  Expect a Good bye.  The good news is that you have it in you to understand that things take time.  You might not like it but you are patient person.  In love, a long-distance relationship falls flat, or a bad romance leaves well, scared and looking over your shoulder. </p>

<p>It’s not a good day when Venus in Aries aspects Jupiter RX in Scorpio at 22°, in your solar sector of personal relationship and significant others, you can expect unfair funny business with your romantic partner, you can feel ignored, betrayed, jealous and you have to watch your credit and banking information.  There’s all kind so of advice you can be getting and great ideas, but will they work out?  But these two planets both beneficial planets so there could be a blessing in disguise.  You can jump into a purely physical relationship or become smitten with someone you think has oodles of money or power.   There’s something wrong with this picture though.  Avoid anyone with grand schemes for our money.  Venus in Aries her detriment, where Venus is not happy and tends to rush to judgement and Jupiter RX is retrograde in Scorpio which is all about intimacy, power, money, magnetism and mysteries.  This suggests either you are not taking enough time to fully get to the bottom of something or you’re not even trying to understand what’s really going on.  Maybe you must explain to someone how your bank account was compromised, and you have a good reason for not paying on time.  Maybe there’s a relationship, partnership or friendship that deep in your heart you’ve been questioning well, the planets are giving you a way out.  More patience is needed this week.  Single Taurus seeks a new romance but is careful not to commit to early on. </p>
