<p><b>Leo: (Mar 19-mar 26):</b>    As your astrology horoscope week begins Leo and Leo Rising the planet Mars ruler of activity, and ruler of your solar sector of new experiences, education, travel, legalities and dreams that come true is in Capricorn your 6th house of work, a grueling daily routine, and employment and health.  You can easily want to mix business with pleasure and find the perfect job that involves travel, wearing different hats and exploring new and innovative ways to do things.  Computers and tech classes could also hold your interest.  Leo can easily make a new role for themselves in any employment situation they find themselves in, just fill a need or a gap.  Mars in Capricorn is all about actions and offensive or defensive plays.  Mars in the sign of Capricorn, is where Mars is exalted.  It’s all business, all about big government, professional ambitions, ethics, professionalism, your career, desire for success and ambitions.   Remember this is where Saturn and Pluto are transiting and where things get very serious and the stakes are high.   Mars is also out of bounds until April 6th too, so think outside the box.  Leo works very hard now but also can get very bored and need something else to break the monotony.  This week you might also take a very serious approach to your health and find enjoyment in competitive sports.

The New Moon started a new cycle in Pisces where the planet Venus is exalted your 8thhouse of joint finances, big money, insurance matters and love affairs.   That could have impacted your finances, in a temporary sort of way or your relationships with women, girlfriends, sisters or just women in general.

The planets Mercury and Venus get together in the sign of Aries this week your solar sector of new experiences, travel, education, learning, tests, red tape and legalities.  There’s communications, sharing ideas, brainstorming and talk about meeting up romantically or making money.   This suggests that you must find the time to do many things.  On the one hand you might have your daily routine and job on the others hand you might be taking a class or have to drive the kids to school with a detour.  It’s as if you must be in two places at one time.  It’s complex crazy and requires lots of organization and planning.  Big ideas and grandiose schemes are talked about, but will they come to fruition?  Mercury rules thinking, communications, new ideas and transportation and is getting ready to go retrograde in Aries making you re-think, redo and think twice or three times about something you said, how you were treated, your finances and when you jumped to conclusions.  By the time Mercury goes direct, Venus will be in a softer place, but a slower moving place, the sign of Taurus, a sign she rules.  This week Venus is in her detriment in Aries and is quick to pooh-pooh ideas, people or activities.  Expect delays and distractions when mercury goes retrograde.  You might be forced to whittle something from your busy schedule this week.

This week the planet Mars influences both Mercury and Venus and remember Mars is out of bounds in the sign of his exaltation Capricorn.  It might not be a good idea to take your frustrations out on those closest to you, but rather reconfigure, or think about changes you can make with your own personal or professional goals.  You can talk over things, get excited by grandiose plans, with new friends or acquaintances, but will they fall short or find fertile ground in the future.   In short, something you do or say this week, like being short, coarse or defensive could impact your future and your relationships.  You can get excited by new people, and conversations but getting short with old friends or family members might be a mistake.  You are working hard towards a goal this week and you might have that lofty goal in plain sight.  Now you just have to put it all together.  Avoid conflicts and being mean.  You might have gotten away with things in the past, but not now.

The Sun enters Aries and it’s the Spring Equinox a time when the Sun is directly above and there’s balance between night and day.  It’s time to also find your own balance.  It’s time to get your life back in balance.  The Sun in Aries suggest it’s time to spring into action, but to also be ready to adjust or make changes for the future when Mercury goes direct after April 15th.  No worries, you’ve got time to think about things.  Leo has to find their balance and center once again.  Slow down and keep your speech and thinking balanced.  Communications and the blurred lines between what’s truthful and what’s not may have had you winging it for some time.

As the planet of love, money, wealth, marriage, women, sisters, and the feminine counterpart of any relationship, the planet Venus in Aries squares Pluto in Capricorn at 21°.  There’s going to be a permanent ending.  Additionally,  the Sun in Aries squares Mars in Capricorn at 3°, expect to feel done with someone or very hurt or disrespected.  There can also be a power play or standoff.  Expect a Good bye.  If you find you have too many conflicts this week the pressure only grows.  Think logically and work hard.

It’s not a good day when Venus in Aries aspects Jupiter RX in Scorpio at 22°, your 4th house of family matters, property matters, your feelings and your need for privacy or to protect your income or family members.  you can expect unfair funny business with your romantic partner, you can feel ignored, betrayed, jealous and you have to watch your credit and banking information.  But these two planets both beneficial planets so there could be a blessing in disguise.  You can jump into a purely physical relationship or become smitten with someone you think has oodles of money or power.   There’s something wrong with this picture though.  Venus in Aries her detriment, where Venus is not happy and tends to rush to judgement and Jupiter RX is retrograde in Scorpio which is all about intimacy, power, money, magnetism and mysteries.  This suggests either you are not taking enough time to fully get to the bottom of something or you’re not even trying to understand what’s really going on.  Maybe you must explain to someone how your bank account was compromised, and you have a good reason for not paying on time.  Maybe there’s a relationship, partnership or friendship that deep in your heart you’ve been questioning well, the planets are giving you a way out.  More patience is needed this week.  This week is a tense week for some Leos.  Leo if a fiery sign who likes to lead.  You might not be a leader this week and that grates at you.
