<p><font size="4" ><p>Forecasters are warning that TWO more Arctic blasts could hit Ireland - at Easter and then again later in April.
Ireland has been left shivering over recent weeks as freezing snaps brought heavy snow and sub-zero temperatures.
The first spell was dubbed the 'Beast from the East', and this was followed by 'the Son of the Beast' last weekend.
Both of these triggered widespread travel chaos with Met Eireann issuing severe weather warnings, including some Red Alerts.</p>

<p>Amy Hodgson from The Weather Channel told Mirror Online that the chilly outlook is due to a sudden stratospheric warming event and polar vortex split which took place back in February. 
She added that the extended cold period is caused by high pressure blocking warmer air from sweeping across the country from the south-west. 
She said: “For April, we expect temperatures to remain below normal across northern Europe. 
“This is still in response to the sudden stratospheric warming event (SSWE) and polar vortex split which occurred back in February.” </p>

<p>Research by Dr Todd Crawford, chief meteorologist at The Weather Channel, also shows that these events can lead to prolonged cold weather and a negative North Atlantic Oscillation 30 to 60 days after the initial split. 
Bitterly cold winds from the east and north-east normally dominate during a negative North Atlantic Oscillation phase. 
This could mean one more ‘Beast from the East’ could occur before May as dry and cold conditions take charge under high pressure throughout much of April. </font></p>
