<p> As your astrology horoscope week begins the planet Mars ruler of your solar sector of home, family matters, property, deeply felt feelings, letting go. Mars rules activity, actions and offensive or defensive plays and is in the sign of Capricorn, your Sun sign where Mars is exalted.  Mars here is all business, all about big government, professional ambitions, ethics, professionalism, your career, desire for success and ambitions.   Remember this is where Saturn and Pluto are transiting and where things get very serious and the stakes are high.   Mars is also out of bounds until April 6th too, so think outside the box.  Capricorn, this rare alignment of Mars in Capricorn when Saturn and Pluto are also in Capricorn means you have a rare opportunity to excel.  Take this unique time to stand out from the crowd.

The New Moon started a new cycle in Pisces where the planet Venus is exalted in your solar sector of communications and all things new another indication to think differently than others.  That could have impacted your finances, in a temporary sort of way or your relationships with women, girlfriends, sisters or just women in general.

The planets Mercury and Venus get together in the sign of Aries this week and influence your emotions, perhaps making you mad and at others times helping you to let go.  There’s communications, sharing ideas, brainstorming and talk about meeting up romantically or making money.   By now, you have learned to let go and quickly move on when things aren’t working out.  This only adds to your tougher than nails mentality but it doesn’t make letting go any easier, just something you do.  You’ve probably had to just move on and let go several times since Uranus has been in this sector of your chart for 7 years.  Big ideas and grandiose schemes are talked about, but will they come to fruition?  Mercury rules thinking, communications, new ideas and transportation and is getting ready to go retrograde in Aries making you re-think, redo and think twice or three times about something you said, how you were treated, your finances and when you jumped to conclusions.  By the time Mercury goes direct, Venus will be in a softer place, but a slower moving place, the sign of Taurus, a sign she rules.  This week Venus is in her detriment in Aries and is quick to pooh-pooh ideas, people or activities.  This week Capricorn acts fast with little remorse.  It’s as it you escape the noose of emotional attachments time and again.  You have set your sights further and are looking ahead to a lucky break, a won and financial security.

This week the planet Mars influences both Mercury and Venus and remember Mars is out of bounds in the sign of his exaltation Capricorn your Sun sign.  You can make quick decisions that are always the right ones to make.  You can equally set yourself apart and be even more persistent about getting ahead and overcoming troubles. The quicker you move on from a difficult emotional tie the better.  It might not be a good idea to take your frustrations out on those closest to you, but rather reconfigure, or think about changes you can make with your own personal or professional goals.  You can talk over things, get excited by grandiose plans, with new friends or acquaintances, but will they fall short or find fertile ground in the future.   In short, something you do or say this week, like being short, coarse or defensive could impact your future and your relationships.  You can get excited by new people, and conversations but getting short with old friends or family members might be a mistake.  This is your week to come out of the gate quickly and forcibly.  You have to overcome financial issues once and for all.

The Sun enters Aries and it’s the Spring Equinox a time when the Sun is directly above and there’s balance between night and day.  It’s time to also find your own balance.  It’s time to get your life back in balance.  The Sun in Aries suggest it’s time to spring into action, but to also be ready to adjust or make changes for the future when Mercury goes direct after April 15th.  No worries, you’ve got time to think about things.  Like everyone else you must regain balance in your life and Capricorn does so privately.  Finding emotional as well as financial security is a necessity now.

As the planet of love, money, wealth, marriage, women, sisters, and the feminine counterpart of any relationship, the planet Venus in Aries squares Pluto in Capricorn at 21° in your Sun sign, and the push to be independent and self-sufficient is very strong and requires strength and character.  There’s going to be a permanent ending.  Additionally,  the Sun in Aries squares Mars in Capricorn at 3°, expect to feel done with someone or very hurt or disrespected.  There can also be a power play or standoff.  Expect a Good bye.

It’s not a good day when Venus in Aries aspects Jupiter RX in Scorpio at 22°, in your 11th house of friends, ex-lovers, groups, associations and powerful influential types you can expect unfair funny business with your romantic partner, you can feel ignored, betrayed, jealous and you have to watch your credit and banking information.  Your feelings can be hurt by a so-called friend or a few so called friends.  In typical Capricorn manner you just move on and cut them loose.  But these two planets both beneficial planets so there could be a blessing in disguise.  You can jump into a purely physical relationship or become smitten with someone you think has oodles of money or power.   There’s something wrong with this picture though.  Venus in Aries her detriment, where Venus is not happy and tends to rush to judgement and Jupiter RX is retrograde in Scorpio which is all about intimacy, power, money, magnetism and mysteries.  This suggests either you are not taking enough time to fully get to the bottom of something or you’re not even trying to understand what’s really going on.  Maybe you must explain to someone how your bank account was compromised, and you have a good reason for not paying on time.  Maybe there’s a relationship, partnership or friendship that deep in your heart you’ve been questioning well, the planets are giving you a way out.  More patience is needed this week.  This week Capricorn you show everyone what you’re really made of.
