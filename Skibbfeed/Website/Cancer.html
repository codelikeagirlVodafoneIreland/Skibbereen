<p><b>cancer: (Mar 19-mar 26):</b>    As your astrology horoscope week begins Cancer and Cancer Rising the planet Mars is the ruler of your solar sector of success, responsibilities, business, professional goals and ambitions and higher ups.  Mars rules activity, actions and offensive or defensive plays is in the sign of Capricorn, where Mars is exalted.  It’s all business, all about big government, professional ambitions, ethics, professionalism, your career, desire for success and ambitions.   Remember this is where Saturn and Pluto are transiting and where things get very serious and the stakes are high.   Mars is also out of bounds until April 6th too, so think outside the box.  In your solar sector of relationships, popularity, marriage and others you can feel that it’s harder to be successful.  That may be true, but you are very capable of succeeding on your own with or without help from others.  This is truly a money in time for you to prove yourself or prove to yourself that you can be successful.  At times, Cancer you can feel that you are attracting combative types or people that can’t be trusted.  Some have “Ulterior Motives” written on the foreheads”.

The New Moon started a new cycle in Pisces where the planet Venus is exalted started a new cycle that ignites your dreams and has you gaining faith and wisdom on your own.   That could have impacted your finances, in a temporary sort of way or your relationships with women, girlfriends, sisters or just women in general.

The planets Mercury and Venus get together in the sign of Aries your 10th house of success, career, business, profession and how you handle responsibilities, this week.  There’s communications, sharing ideas, brainstorming and talk about meeting up romantically or making money.   Mercury brings communications or lack of communications and Venus brings benefits and gain to your career and professional life and goals.  It’s lonely at the top.  This week it feels like you are on your own.  You may have to be a single parent and handle all your professional affairs too.  You can do it.  You can manage the maze of big business or handle all your responsibilities with a little effort.  Now Big ideas and grandiose schemes are talked about, but will they come to fruition?  Mercury rules thinking, communications, new ideas and transportation and is getting ready to go retrograde in Aries making you re-think, redo and think twice or three times about something you said, how you were treated, your finances and when you jumped to conclusions.  By the time Mercury goes direct, Venus will be in a softer place, but a slower moving place, the sign of Taurus, a sign she rules.  This week Venus is in her detriment in Aries and is quick to pooh-pooh ideas, people or activities.  Since there are those who don’t see your strength you can also get angry!

This week the planet Mars influences both Mercury and Venus and remember Mars is out of bounds in the sign of his exaltation Capricorn your relationship and others zone.  This is actually and intercepted aspect for Cancer who chooses to get things done and not relay on others this week.  It might not be a good idea to take your frustrations out on those closest to you, but rather reconfigure, or think about changes you can make with your own personal or professional goals.  You can talk over things, get excited by grandiose plans, with new friends or acquaintances, but will they fall short or find fertile ground in the future.   In short, something you do or say this week, like being short, coarse or defensive could impact your future and your relationships.  You can get excited by new people, and conversations but getting short with old friends or family members might be a mistake.  You’re all business and have no time for games.  When it comes to having fun, you’ll have fun doing something relaxing on your own since relationships try your patience this week.

The Sun enters Aries and it’s the Spring Equinox a time when the Sun is directly above and there’s balance between night and day.  It’s time to also find your own balance.  It’s time to get your life back in balance.  The Sun in Aries suggest it’s time to spring into action, but to also be ready to adjust or make changes for the future when Mercury goes direct after April 15th.  No worries, you’ve got time to think about things.  Cancer must get their family, homes, and responsibilities back in balance.  You have to put your own home and family first and others second.  It’s time to get your priorities straight.

As the planet of love, money, wealth, marriage, women, sisters, and the feminine counterpart of any relationship, the planet Venus in Aries squares Pluto in Capricorn at 21°.  No one is going to like it when you say Goodbye but, if you’re not getting respected you must say Goodbye to some people.  There’s going to be a permanent ending.  Additionally,  the Sun in Aries squares Mars in Capricorn at 3°, expect to feel done with someone or very hurt or disrespected.  There can also be a power play or standoff.  Expect a Good bye.  You can’t allow anyone to undermine your self-confidence now.  In love, you can’t allow a love interest to play crazy games with you.  Just say Bye!

It’s not a good day when Venus in Aries aspects Jupiter RX in Scorpio at 22°, in your 5th house of love romance and children you can expect unfair funny business with your romantic partner, you can feel ignored, betrayed, jealous and you have to watch your credit and banking information.  Cancer has to be firm, responsible and make everyone follow the rules this week.  As soon as you feel anyone is being cheeky, or a smart aleck get out of the situation.  But these two planets both beneficial planets so there could be a blessing in disguise.  You can jump into a purely physical relationship or become smitten with someone you think has oodles of money or power.   There’s something wrong with this picture though.  Venus in Aries her detriment, where Venus is not happy and tends to rush to judgement and Jupiter RX is retrograde in Scorpio which is all about intimacy, power, money, magnetism and mysteries.  This suggests either you are not taking enough time to fully get to the bottom of something or you’re not even trying to understand what’s really going on.  Maybe you must explain to someone how your bank account was compromised, and you have a good reason for not paying on time.  Maybe there’s a relationship, partnership or friendship that deep in your heart you’ve been questioning well, the planets are giving you a way out.  More patience is needed this week.  Opportunities for love, and romance will come and go this year.  Consider letting one go this week that’s not working out.
