<p> As your astrology horoscope week begins Scorpio and Scorpio Rising the planet Mars your co-ruler and ruler of your 6thhouse of work, health, maintenance, fixing things, helpfulness or not, and daily routine is in Capricorn.  Mars is also the ruler of activity, actions and offensive or defensive plays is in the sign of Capricorn, where Mars is exalted.  This means you can be extra sensitive to criticism and perhaps get a little scrappy yourself.  So, it’s important that you stick to the facts and avoid anyone you feel is looking for an argument. Because you’re ready at any moment to tell someone off too.  Say it isn’t so.  A better way to manage this energy is to try to let go of past grumbles.  Focus instead on your health, buying new clothes and looking younger or better than ever.  It’s actually a good time to work out, train and get in shape.  Scorpio loves to look good.   Mars in Scorpio is all business, all about big government, professional ambitions, ethics, professionalism, your career, desire for success and ambitions.   Remember this is where Saturn and Pluto are transiting and where things get very serious and the stakes are high.   Mars is also out of bounds until April 6th too, so think outside the box.  A serious money-making idea is in the works.

<p>The New Moon started a new cycle in Pisces where the planet Venus is exalted.   The new Moon could have brought a victory or made you happy in some way.  Perhaps it opened your social life up and made you think about having fun again.   That could have impacted your finances, in a temporary sort of way or your relationships with women, girlfriends, sisters or just women in general.  Maybe you came close to winning something!  </p>

<p>The planets Mercury and Venus get together in the sign of Aries this week and that can make you get back to work with a fierce enthusiasm.  You might need extra help, or you can realize how much you can do on your own.  It depends on your personal planets.  Aries is the sign of independence after all.  So, realizing how capable you really are is always encouraging.  Since the planet Uranus has been in this area of your chart for 7 years you’ve gotten used to mastering some things on your own.  There’s communications, sharing ideas, brainstorming and talk about meeting up romantically or making money.   Big ideas and grandiose schemes are talked about, but will they come to fruition?  Mercury rules thinking, communications, new ideas and transportation and is getting ready to go retrograde in Aries making you re-think, redo and think twice or three times about something you said, how you were treated, your finances and when you jumped to conclusions.  By the time Mercury goes direct, Venus will be in a softer place, but a slower moving place, the sign of Taurus, a sign she rules.  This week Venus is in her detriment in Aries and is quick to pooh-pooh ideas, people or activities. You could be thinking about changing jobs, finding a job and doing more for yourself.  Key phrase “I got this!”

<p>There’s always going to be some Scorpios who have to fight that chip on their shoulder and their inner anger, oh my!</p>

<p>This week the planet Mars influences both Mercury and Venus and remember Mars is out of bounds in the sign of his exaltation Capricorn.  That means a good idea or thinking outside the box might be just what you need.  Jupiter is after all is bringing in a new cycle and 2nd or 3rd chances, to start life over again.  It might not be a good idea to take your frustrations out on those closest to you, but rather reconfigure, or think about changes you can make with your own personal or professional goals.  You can talk over things, get excited by grandiose plans, with new friends or acquaintances, but will they fall short or find fertile ground in the future.   In short, something you do or say this week, like being short, coarse or defensive could impact your future and your relationships.  You can get excited by new people, and conversations but getting short with old friends or family members might be a mistake.  Scorpio should seize the golden ring of opportunity and not listen to the criticism that comes their way.  That doesn’t mean you should go looking for a fight or try to make anyone mad at you.

The Sun enters Aries and it’s the Spring Equinox a time when the Sun is directly above and there’s balance between night and day.  It’s time to also find your own balance.  It’s time to get your life back in balance.  The Sun in Aries suggest it’s time to spring into action, but to also be ready to adjust or make changes for the future when Mercury goes direct after April 15th.  No worries, you’ve got time to think about things.  Time once again to re-arrange life and find balance.  This is easy or hard depending on how out of balance your life is.  Doing things on your own and being less dependent on others or a relationship is a good thing.  It’s all about you now and you can manage just fine.

As the planet of love, money, wealth, marriage, women, sisters, and the feminine counterpart of any relationship, the planet Venus in Aries squares Pluto in Capricorn at 21°.  There can be paper work and things that need to be filed or organized so don’t put it off.  There’s going to be a permanent ending and Scorpio decides who to speak to, communicate with and who not to.  Additionally,  the Sun in Aries squares Mars in Capricorn at 3°, expect to feel done with someone or very hurt or disrespected.  There can also be a power play or standoff.  Expect a Good bye or expect to block calls or emails. Occasionally, you just don’t feel like talking much.  You’re busy after all.

It’s not a good day when Venus in Aries aspects Jupiter RX in Scorpio at 22°, you can expect unfair funny business with your romantic partner, you can feel ignored, betrayed, jealous and you have to watch your credit and banking information.  This aspect can be painful.  It can affect your health.  But these two planets both beneficial planets so there could be a blessing in disguise.  You can jump into a purely physical relationship or become smitten with someone you think has oodles of money or power.   There’s something wrong with this picture though.  Venus in Aries her detriment, where Venus is not happy and tends to rush to judgement and Jupiter RX is retrograde in Scorpio which is all about intimacy, power, money, magnetism and mysteries.  This suggests either you are not taking enough time to fully get to the bottom of something or you’re not even trying to understand what’s really going on.  Maybe you must explain to someone how your bank account was compromised, and you have a good reason for not paying on time.  Maybe there’s a relationship, partnership or friendship that deep in your heart you’ve been questioning well, the planets are giving you a way out.  More patience is needed this week.  Aches and pains must be checked
