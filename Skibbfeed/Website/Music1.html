<p><font size="4" > Demi reached six years of sobriety this week — and she celebrated the milestone with a powerful speech at her concert on Friday night.
  "Yesterday was a really big day for me," Lovato shared, to big cheers from the crowd.
  “Yesterday, six years ago, I was drinking vodka out of a Sprite bottle at 9 in the morning, throwing up in the car. And I just remember thinking, ‘This is no longer cute. This is no longer fun. And I’m just like my dad.’"
"So I took a look at my life and I said, ‘Something has to change, something has to change. I’ve got to get sober.' So I did," she explained, as a stagehand rushed to hand her tissues.
"I made changes in my life, and the reason I became so open about my story is because I know that there are people here tonight that need to ask for help, and I want you to know that it's okay."</p>
<p>Demi then talked about how important it is to get rid of the stigma around mental health:
Mental health is something that we all need to talk about, and we need to take the stigma away from it. So let’s raise the awareness. Let’s let everybody know it’s okay to have a mental illness, it’s okay to have an addiction problem. I’m bipolar — like, whatever! I take care of myself. And I can never say ‘Thank you’ enough to you guys for the support that you’ve given me over the years, and you’ve forgiven me for my mistakes.</font></p>
