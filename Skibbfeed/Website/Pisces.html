<p> As your astrology horoscope week begins Pisces and Pisces Rising the planet Mars ruler of your 2ndhouse of money, wealth and luxuries, and the ruler of activity, actions and offensive or defensive plays is in the sign of Capricorn, where Mars is exalted.  That means you might once again take decisive measures to get ahead financially or make a large purchase.  You have things you want now.  You’re all business about getting what you want too.  Mars in Capricorn is all about corporations, higher ups, big government, professional ambitions, ethics, professionalism, your career, desire for success and ambitions.   Remember this is where Saturn and Pluto are transiting and where things get very serious and the stakes are high.   Mars is also out of bounds until April 6th too, so think outside the box.  Try to get others to help you. Influential people like in-laws, the boss or the bosses boss, friends, mentors, people you find through networking might be instrumental in you making some fundamental change in how you earn or spend your money.

The New Moon started a new cycle in Pisces your Sun sign where the planet Venus is exalted.   This ignited a whole new cycle where being an individual and following what you want to do what you want to do became more important.  That could have impacted your finances, in a temporary sort of way or your relationships with women, girlfriends, sisters or just women in general.  This week the theme continues it’s all about making changes.

The planets Mercury and Venus get together in the sign of Aries your 2nd house of money, wealth and spending this week.  There’s communications, sharing ideas, brainstorming and talk about meeting up romantically or making money.   The key word now is “New” and the phrase is “Taking charge”.  Big ideas and grandiose schemes are talked about, but will they come to fruition?  Mercury rules thinking, communications, new ideas and transportation and is getting ready to go retrograde in Aries making you re-think, redo and think twice or three times about something you said, how you were treated, your finances and when you jumped to conclusions.  By the time Mercury goes direct, Venus will be in a softer place, but a slower moving place, the sign of Taurus, a sign she rules.  This week Venus is in her detriment in Aries and is quick to pooh-pooh ideas, people or activities. In the end you’ll make your own decisions and choices but hearing other’s ideas whether you agree with them or not is important.  Set your sights high and you can achieve anything.

This week the planet Mars influences both Mercury and Venus and remember Mars is out of bounds in the sign of his exaltation Capricorn so thinking outside the box when it comes to friends, mentors, large corporations you might work for, and influential people in your life like in-laws or groups you belong to or socialize with, can be very helpful and advantageous now.  It might not be a good idea to take your frustrations out on those closest to you, but rather reconfigure, or think about changes you can make with your own personal or professional goals.  You can talk over things, get excited by grandiose plans, with new friends or acquaintances, but will they fall short or find fertile ground in the future.   In short, something you do or say this week, like being short, coarse or defensive could impact your future and your relationships.  You can get excited by new people, and conversations but getting short with old friends or family members might be a mistake.  Just because someone recommends that you do something doesn’t mean you have to do it.

The Sun enters Aries and it’s the Spring Equinox a time when the Sun is directly above and there’s balance between night and day.  It’s time to also find your own balance.  It’s time to get your life back in balance.  The Sun in Aries suggest it’s time to spring into action, but to also be ready to adjust or make changes for the future when Mercury goes direct after April 15th.  No worries, you’ve got time to think about things.  Pisces this means that you’re taking a close look at your finances and maybe what you would like to acquire.  That can be a new car or investments you’d like to make.  So, focus on getting back to a budget to get ahead.

As the planet of love, money, wealth, marriage, women, sisters, and the feminine counterpart of any relationship, the planet Venus in Aries squares Pluto in Capricorn at 21°.  Plan for or try to avoid unexpected expenses.  Avoid get rich quick schemes or pyramid schemes.  Someone wants to tell you what to do with your money, it’s up to you if you listen.  Let the buyer beware!  There’s going to be a permanent ending and that could be with a friend or influential person, in law or group you’re associated with.  Additionally,  the Sun in Aries squares Mars in Capricorn at 3°, expect to feel done with someone or very hurt or disrespected.  There can also be a power play or standoff.  Expect a Good bye.  Don’t get upset It might just be the pinch you feel from the new budget!

It’s not a good day when Venus in Aries aspects Jupiter RX in Scorpio at 22°, you can expect unfair funny business with your romantic partner, you can feel ignored, betrayed, jealous and you have to watch your credit and banking information.  This suggests that you might need professional help, or you might have to look into things related to your finances deeper.  You can’t just accept anything that has to do with your money at face value this week.  But these two planets both beneficial planets so there could be a blessing in disguise.  You can jump into a purely physical relationship or become smitten with someone you think has oodles of money or power.   There’s something wrong with this picture though.  Venus in Aries her detriment, where Venus is not happy and tends to rush to judgement and Jupiter RX is retrograde in Scorpio which is all about intimacy, power, money, magnetism and mysteries.  This suggests either you are not taking enough time to fully get to the bottom of something or you’re not even trying to understand what’s really going on.  Maybe you must explain to someone how your bank account was compromised, and you have a good reason for not paying on time.  Maybe there’s a relationship, partnership or friendship that deep in your heart you’ve been questioning well, the planets are giving you a way out.  More patience is needed this week.  This week Pisces gets back in the green.
