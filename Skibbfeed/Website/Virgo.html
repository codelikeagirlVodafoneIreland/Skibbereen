<p><b>Virgo: (Aug. 24-Sep. 23):<b> As your astrology horoscope week begins Virgo and Virgo Rising the planet Mars ruler of your 8th house of joint finances, overcoming hurdles and reigniting your drive and energy also rules  activity, actions and offensive or defensive plays.  Mars is in the sign of Capricorn, where Mars is exalted.  That’s good news for Virgo as it relates to getting or raising your self-confidence, making you a winner and bringing lots of sexual magnetism to your life.  But still it’s all business, all about big government, professional ambitions, ethics, professionalism, your career, desire for success and ambitions.   Remember this is where Saturn and Pluto are transiting and where things get very serious and the stakes are high.   Mars is also out of bounds until April 6th too, so think outside the box.  Virgo needs to know where they stand this week and where things are headed or going.  Your ambitions can at times dull the hot romance that Mars usually promises.  This week things like investments, your children’s future, gambles or risks you’ve taken weigh heavy on your mind.

The New Moon started a new cycle in Pisces where the planet Venus is exalted your solar sector of relationships, marriage and others.  There’s a healing quality to your connections with others.  That could have impacted your finances, in a temporary sort of way or your relationships with women, girlfriends, sisters or just women in general.

The planets Mercury and Venus get together in the sign of Aries this week.  Mercury your ruler and Venus blend their energies in your 8th house a Pluto ruled house.  This can make you wonder about finances, what’s ahead or the future of a relationship and what you can do to make it better.  There’s communications, sharing ideas, brainstorming and talk about meeting up romantically or making money.   Big ideas and grandiose schemes are talked about, but will they come to fruition?  Mercury rules thinking, communications, new ideas and transportation and is getting ready to go retrograde in Aries making you re-think, redo and think twice or three times about something you said, how you were treated, your finances and when you jumped to conclusions.  By the time Mercury goes direct, Venus will be in a softer place, but a slower moving place, the sign of Taurus, a sign she rules and you will have a better perspective on your future and the future of your love life.  Until then it just feels uncomfortable or overwhelming.  This week Venus is in her detriment in Aries and is quick to pooh-pooh ideas, people or activities.

This week the planet Mars influences both Mercury and Venus and remember Mars is out of bounds in the sign of his exaltation Capricorn.  Virgo you have lots of good fortune and power at your disposal if you can just muster more self-confidence, drive and feel like a winner.   You might even meet someone new this week and chances are if you do it could throw a monkey wrench into an existing relationship.  It might not be a good idea to take your frustrations out on those closest to you, but rather reconfigure, or think about changes you can make with your own personal or professional goals.  You can talk over things, get excited by grandiose plans, with new friends or acquaintances, but will they fall short or find fertile ground in the future.   In short, something you do or say this week, like being short, coarse or defensive could impact your future and your relationships.  You can get excited by new people, and conversations but getting short with old friends or family members might be a mistake.

If you have children, you’ll want to keep a close eye on them.

The Sun enters Aries and it’s the Spring Equinox a time when the Sun is directly above and there’s balance between night and day.  It’s time to also find your own balance.  It’s time to get your life back in balance.  The Sun in Aries suggest it’s time to spring into action, but to also be ready to adjust or make changes for the future when Mercury goes direct after April 15th.  No worries, you’ve got time to think about things.  Virgo that means it’s time to find your balance and figure out a way forward.  Do you stay, or do you go?  In the past moving on might have been difficult but you are better prepared this week to move on from a dysfunctional relationship.  You also come up with a serious financial plan that puts you back in the green.

As the planet of love, money, wealth, marriage, women, sisters, and the feminine counterpart of any relationship, the planet Venus in Aries squares Pluto in Capricorn at 21°.  There’s going to be a permanent ending.  This aspect has everything, jealousy, tirades and standoffs.  It has it all.  Additionally,  the Sun in Aries squares Mars in Capricorn at 3°, expect to feel done with someone or very hurt or disrespected.  There can also be a power play or standoff.  Expect a Good bye.  It becomes clear to you what you’re getting out of a situation and what you’re not getting.  It’s the Spring Equinox so hard decisions have to be made to get you back into balance.

It’s not a good day when Venus in Aries aspects Jupiter RX in Scorpio at 22°, you can expect unfair funny business with your romantic partner, you can feel ignored, betrayed, jealous and you have to watch your credit and banking information.  For Virgo this is an intercepted aspect and that means it’s effects are lessened, and you can handle it.  An unexpected bill come in the mail or an unexpected phone call from a love interest stops you in your tracks.  But these two planets both beneficial planets so there could be a blessing in disguise.  You can jump into a purely physical relationship or become smitten with someone you think has oodles of money or power.   There’s something wrong with this picture though.  Venus in Aries her detriment, where Venus is not happy and tends to rush to judgement and Jupiter RX is retrograde in Scorpio which is all about intimacy, power, money, magnetism and mysteries.  This suggests either you are not taking enough time to fully get to the bottom of something or you’re not even trying to understand what’s really going on.  Maybe you must explain to someone how your bank account was compromised, and you have a good reason for not paying on time.  Maybe there’s a relationship, partnership or friendship that deep in your heart you’ve been questioning well, the planets are giving you a way out.  More patience is needed this week.  This week Virgo while romance may be complicated you’re ready to tackle anything even a tough decision.
