<p> As your astrology horoscope week begins Aquarius and Aquarius Rising the planet Mars ruler of your 3rd house of thinking, grand ideas, brain storming and communications is in Capricorn.  Mars is the ruler of activity, actions and offensive or defensive plays and is in the sign of Capricorn, where Mars is exalted.  This is your 12th house of completions, part time work, or employment, out of the way places, and behind the scenes help.  It’s all business, all about big government, professional ambitions, ethics, professionalism, your career, desire for success and ambitions.   Remember this is where Saturn and Pluto are transiting and where things get very serious and the stakes are high.   Mars is also out of bounds until April 6th too, so think outside the box.  Remember this is a rare transit of Mars because it will meet up with Saturn and Pluto and that doesn’t happen all the time.  No doubt this has you thinking about a dream you have and if the dream is still alive and can you still achieve it.

The New Moon started a new cycle in Pisces where the planet Venus is exalted your 2nd house of money, wealth and self-esteem.   That could have impacted your finances, in a temporary sort of way or your relationships with women, girlfriends, sisters or just women in general.

The planets Mercury and Venus get together in the sign of Aries this week.  This is where communications, the sharing ideas, brainstorming and talks meets up with money matters, romance and partnerships or making money together.   This week you face the real dilemma of what’s ahead and you need a plan B.  Big ideas and grandiose schemes are talked about, but will they come to fruition?  It doesn’t mean that you’ll give up a dream, No far from it.  But even you need something new to fill the down time, or the time in between jobs with.  Mercury rules thinking, communications, new ideas and transportation and is getting ready to go retrograde in Aries making you re-think, redo and think twice or three times about something you said, how you were treated, your finances and when you jumped to conclusions.  By the time Mercury goes direct, Venus will be in a softer place, but a slower moving place, the sign of Taurus, a sign she rules.  This week Venus is in her detriment in Aries and is quick to pooh-pooh ideas, people or activities.

This week the planet Mars influences both Mercury and Venus and remember Mars is out of bounds in the sign of his exaltation Capricorn so you are at least open to a new dream or idea.  It might not be a good idea to take your frustrations out on those closest to you, but rather reconfigure, or think about changes you can make with your own personal or professional goals.  You can talk over things, get excited by grandiose plans, with new friends or acquaintances, but will they fall short or find fertile ground in the future.   In short, something you do or say this week, like being short, coarse or defensive could impact your future and your relationships.  You can get excited by new people, and conversations but getting short with old friends or family members might be a mistake.  It’s not so easy for a fixed sign like Aquarius to be open to anything new.  Once you have your mind set on something that’s usually it.  But this week even you are thinking outside the box and that’s a good thing.

The Sun enters Aries and it’s the Spring Equinox a time when the Sun is directly above and there’s balance between night and day.  It’s time to also find your own balance.  It’s time to get your life back in balance.  The Sun in Aries suggest it’s time to spring into action, but to also be ready to adjust or make changes for the future when Mercury goes direct after April 15th.  No worries, you’ve got time to think about things.  Each year around this time it’s all about re-aligning ourselves and gaining more balance.  You can realize how far out of balance you are.  Get back to who you really are.  Find your balance between what’s right to do and what you want to do.  Be true to yourself.  You don’t need to be the hope for someone else’s dreams.

As the planet of love, money, wealth, marriage, women, sisters, and the feminine counterpart of any relationship, the planet Venus in Aries squares Pluto in Capricorn at 21°.  You can be at a loss for word and so shaken that you don’t know what to say or how to communicate with someone close.  There’s going to be a permanent ending.  Additionally,  the Sun in Aries squares Mars in Capricorn at 3°, expect to feel done with someone or very hurt or disrespected.  There can also be a power play or standoff.  Expect a Good bye.

It’s not a good day when Venus in Aries aspects Jupiter RX in Scorpio at 22°, in your success zone you can expect unfair funny business with your romantic partner, you can feel ignored, betrayed, jealous and you have to watch your credit and banking information.  But these two planets both beneficial planets so there could be a blessing in disguise.  You can jump into a purely physical relationship or become smitten with someone you think has oodles of money or power.   There’s something wrong with this picture though.  Venus in Aries her detriment, where Venus is not happy and tends to rush to judgement and Jupiter RX is retrograde in Scorpio which is all about intimacy, power, money, magnetism and mysteries.  This suggests either you are not taking enough time to fully get to the bottom of something or you’re not even trying to understand what’s really going on.  Maybe you must explain to someone how your bank account was compromised, and you have a good reason for not paying on time.  Maybe there’s a relationship, partnership or friendship that deep in your heart you’ve been questioning well, the planets are giving you a way out.  More patience is needed this week.  Everyone needs hope and this week you need to keep your dreams alive and do what’s necessary to keep realizing your own personal goals.
