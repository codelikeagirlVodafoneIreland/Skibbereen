  <b><u> History</u></b>
  <br>
  <li>Skibbereen is a town in County Cork, Ireland. It is located on the N71 national secondary road.The name "Skibbereen" means "little boat harbour". The River Ilen runs through the town; it reaches the sea about 12 kilometers away, at the seaside village of Baltimore. As of the Census of Ireland 2011, the population of the town  Skibbereen is in the Cork South–West (Dáil Éireann) constituency, which has five seats.</li>

  <b><u>Cuisine</u></b>
  <br>
  <li>The Church Restaurant is located in the heart of Skibbereen Town in West Cork. Steeped in history, it was originally a Methodist Church from 1833 to 2003 and still retains the character and charm with lovely stained glass windows and high wooden ceilings. The Church Restaurant is open 7 days a week serving a variety of locally sourced produce. All the meat served in this restaurant is of Irish origin and purchased in the local butcher shop. Fresh fish comes from the local shores of Union Hall and vegetables are purchased daily from local suppliers. We look forward to welcoming you to the Church Restaurant, Skibbereen.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Good Things is the creation of chef, boss and mother extraordinaire, Carmel Somers. Carmel is a passionate chef who cooks simple and fresh food. Her timeline goes something like this,
Carmel trained in Paris after being told if she wanted to learn about good food:
“Well, you’ve just got to go to Paris”.
So off she went. She worked in Lous Landes and also with John Desmond (of Heir Island) and cooked for families as well as au pairing. She temporarily returned to Ireland before moving to England where she worked in many different restaurants, learning what she could along the way. From Whites of Cricklade to Bibendum in London to Sally Clarke's and Markwicks in Bristol. In these food Meccas she soaked up all the knowledge she now utilises daily. Then, years later, she and her three daughters relocated to West Cork. Durrus, to be precise. </li>
