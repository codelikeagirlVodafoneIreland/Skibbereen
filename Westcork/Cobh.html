   <b><u> History</u></b>
   <br>
   <li>Cobh Known from 1849 until 1920 as Queenstown, is a tourist seaport town on the south coast of County Cork, Ireland. Cobh is on the south side of Great Island in Cork Harbour and is home to Ireland's only dedicated cruise terminal. Tourism in the area draws on the maritime and emigration legacy of the town - including its association with the RMS Titanic, which was built in Belfast.</li>
     <br>
   <li>Rail-Outside of the Dublin metropolitan area, Cobh is one of the few towns in Ireland served by a commuter train service. The town is one of two termini for Cork Commuter Services. The other is Midleton. Regular commuter services run between Cork city and Cobh, calling at, among others, Fota railway station, Carrigaloe railway station, and Rushbrooke railway station, along the way. Trains run every day and the journey time to Cork is under 25 minutes.

Cobh-railway station opened on 10 March 1862 and was closed for goods traffic on 3 November 1975.[8]

Air-
The nearest airport is Cork Airport - which can be reached in 20â€“30 minutes from Cobh via the R624 road and the N25 road.

Port-
The Port Operations Centre for Cork Harbour is located in the town. The port's harbour pilot launches are based at the Camber - a pier and dock are at the eastern end of the town.

Roads-
Currently there is only a single road that leads onto the Great Island, however a major upgrade of the R624 road is planned[citation needed] which is to include the construction of a new bridge (replacing the old Belvelly bridge) and road from Belvelly in the north of Cobh, to Tullagreen where the R624 road joins the N25 road from Cork City to Rosslare at the N25 Carrigtwohill-Cobh Interchange.[citation needed]

Cross River Ferry-
In 1993 a Cross River Ferry was established which allowed cars and passengers to travel from Glenbrook near Monkstown to Carrigaloe on the Great Island. The crossing from Glenbrook to Carrigaloe takes four minutes and runs daily. Reservations are not required.</li>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Cuisine</u></b>
<br>
<li>The Quays Bar and Restaurant.
  With a private marina and a large outdoor seating area, The Quays is the perfect location to enjoy the breathtaking scenery in the heart of Cobh Harbour.</li>
<br>
<li>The Titanic Bar and Grill.Food-
Carefully designed menus, quality suppliers and a contemporary, stylish atmosphere combine to provide an ideal setting for you enjoyment.</li>
