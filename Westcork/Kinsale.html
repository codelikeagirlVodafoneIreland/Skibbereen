   <b><u> History</u></b>
   <br>
   <li>Kinsale (meaning "Tide Head") is a historic port and fishing town in County Cork, Ireland, which also has significant military history. Located approximately 25 km south of Cork City on the coast near the Old Head of Kinsale, it sits at the mouth of the River Bandon and had a population of 5,281 at the 2016 census.[1] Its population increases during the summer months when the tourist season is at its peak and when the boating fraternity and other tourist visitors arrive in numbers. Kinsale is in the Cork South–West (Dáil Éireann) constituency, which has five seats.</li>
   <li>Kinsale is a holiday destination for Irish and overseas tourists. Leisure activities include yachting, sea angling, and golf. The town also has several art galleries and a school of English. There is a large yachting marina close to the town centre.
   The town is known for its restaurants, and holds an annual "Gourmet Festival". Chef Keith Floyd was previously a resident of Kinsale.</li>
   <br>
   <br>
   <b><u>Cuisine</u></b>
   <br>
   <li>Finns' Table Restaurant was opened in 2013 by John & Julie Finn who are a husband and wife team in the picturesque medieval fishing town of Kinsale. We are delighted to announce that we have been recommended again by the Michelin Guide for 2017.
   John is the chef running the kitchen and Julie is your welcome at front of house.
   Our kitchen has a refined Irish French style of cooking, where classic taste and scent combinations are given a modern twist. The cuisine is adventurous and imaginative without being precious.  All the dishes are prepared with daily fresh local ingredients and alll the beef, lamb and pork is supplied by John's parents who are the owners of Finn's Butchers in Mitchelstown (Est 1830) hense the meat is only the very best here. Obviously the fish is the freshest being so close to the water.  Our Lobsters and Crab are caught locally, off the Old Head of Kinsale by Yammon O' Neill.  Prime fresh fish such as Turbot, John Dory & Hake is souced daily from trawlers in West Cork.</li>
