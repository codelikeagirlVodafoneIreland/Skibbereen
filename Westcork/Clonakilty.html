   <b><u> History</u></b>
   <br>
   <li>Clonakilty (/ˈklɔːnæˌkɪltiː/; Irish: Cloich na Coillte, Clanna Chaoilte), sometimes shortened to Clon, is a town in County Cork, Ireland. The town is located at the head of the tidal Clonakilty Bay. The rural hinterland is used mainly for dairy farming.[7] The town's population as of 2016 was 4,592.[8] The town is a tourism hub in West Cork, and was recognised as the "Best Town in Europe" in 2017, and "Best Place of the Year" in 2017 by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland.</li>
   <br>
   <li>Michael Collins, who was the Director of Intelligence for the IRA, which sought independence from Britain in the 1920–1921 period, lived in Clonakilty and attended the local boys' national school. Collins later served as Chairman of the Provisional Government and was instrumental in the founding of the Irish Free State. Collins was killed in an Anti-Treaty ambush during the Civil War. He gave several orations from O'Donovan's Hotel on the Main Street of Clonakilty. A statue of Michael Collins by local artist Kevin Holland was erected and dedicated in 2002 at the junction of Bridge Street and Emmet Square.</li>
